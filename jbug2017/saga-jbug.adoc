== Distributed transactions

[.stretch]
image:{images}/saga/posta-msa-with-wfly.png[role="noborder stretch"]

== An ACID transaction

* An atomic unit of the work where everything or nothing is finished
** usually in regards of data manipulation
* Protecting shared resources from multiple users
* A notion of a global consensus
* ACID properties guaranteed

*Atomicity*::
  "all or nothing", all operations in a transaction succeed or every operation is rolled back
*Consistency*::
  on the completion of a transaction, the database is structurally sound
  that covers e.g. preserve foreign keys, uniqueness defined by schema etc.
*Isolation*::
  transactions do not contend with one another. Contentious access to data is moderated by the database
  so that transactions appear to run sequentially.
*Durability*::
  the results of applying a transaction are permanent, even in the presence of failures

== Distributed vs. XA transaction

* distributed transaction runs over multiple services
* XA transaction joins operations over multiple resources

== XA handling

image:{images}/saga/xa_handling.png[role="noborder"]


== XA transaction: 2PC

== Demo

* XA transaction coordinates non-homogenous participants
* scaling troubles in distributed environment
* https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/TwoPhaseCommit2PC

== ACID distributed transactions: assuming

* closely coupled environment
** harder to scale
** tight data coupling
* short duration
** locking reduces parallelism

== Microservice architecture: expecting

* loosely coupling
* scaling
* long duration activities

== Sagas

* Transactional model for long living transaction
* Saga paper (H. Garcia-Molina, K. Salem;  1987)
* Relaxing ACID properties
* Eventual consistent

* Web services: WS-BA specification, SOA design pattern
* REST and event sourcing: microservices

[NOTE.speaker]

Original paper talks about Saga as a solution for long-lived database transactions.
We can use it for distributed environment too for not using two phase commit (a.k.a. locks).

Other names:

* Sagas
* Saga transactions
* Saga actions
* Business Activities (BA)
* Long running actions (LRA)
* Long Living transactions (LLT)

== Sagas (#2)

image:{images}/saga/saga_confirm.png[role="noborder"]

* consists of a sequence of autonomous operations, each immediatelly visible to outer world
* responsibility of failures handling to developer (handlers)
* transaction manager is responsible for calling handlers


== Sagas (#3)

image:{images}/saga/saga_compensate.png[role="noborder"]

* compensation handler defined by developer, called by transaction manager


== Saga transaction

The concept of the original paper talks about single node database but it could
be applied to distributed transactions (as was already shown).

Saga could be classified as `Base` transaction (at least from my understanding)
as it does not lock resources a.k.a locks and letting data of resources being available
for other transactions to work with.

As you could see the transaction handling introduced by Saga requires the application to
define compensation actions or define actions as idempotent (you can repeat operation on the
resource multiple times and you will get the same result - operation being repeated not leading to a different outcome).

Still you can handle all the data integrity yourself in your application and design your system architecture
to handle with failures. It's up to you if concept of Saga is useful for you or not.

== Narayana LRA

* LRA: Long Running Actions
* Saga implementation for REST calls
* based on the Eclipse MicroProfile stack (JAX-RS, CDI)

To get logs for the particular services:

* `oc logs -f `oc get pods | grep ^ola | grep Running | awk '{ print $1 }'``
* `oc logs -f `oc get pods | grep ^hola | grep Running | awk '{ print $1 }'``
* `oc logs -f `oc get pods | grep ^aloha | grep Running | awk '{ print $1 }'``
* `oc logs -f `oc get pods | grep ^bonjour | grep Running | awk '{ print $1 }'``

== Summary

* Narayana LRA - implementation of Saga for REST calls
* a better fit for MSA than ACID transactions
* a tool that can help in desiging the application
** MSA principles should be preserved
